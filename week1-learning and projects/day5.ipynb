      "Presenter: Daniel van Strien, Machine Learning Librarian at Hugging Face\n",
      "\n",
      "Daniel will deliver a short practical workshop on how the LAM community can prepare data for use in machine learning projects and how machine learning and AI tools can be used to transform existing collections into data. This will include an overview of what the Hugging Face Hub is, how LAM institutions are using it to benefit from, and contribute to, the open source machine learning ecosystem and a hands on walkthrough of how you can use the Hub to share open datasets.\n",

      "Yesterday we merged a PR deprecating TensorFlow and Flax support in transformers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going forward, we're focusing all our efforts on PyTorch to remove a lot of the bloating in the transformers library. Expect a simpler toolkit, across the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is not a decision we take lightly: multi-backend has been a big selling point of transformers over the years. However, we have seen our user base consolidate in PyTorch.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will keep support of TF and Flax with v4 as LTS (~mid 2026). This change marks the beginning of v5!\n",
      "\n",
      "We have heard the feedback about transformers being bloated with many layers of abstraction. \n",
      "\n",
      "With this, we expect to remove 50% of the code from the library. This will contribute to removing abstraction layers; aligned with our focus on simplification:\n",
      "https://lnkd.in/eRMMj_fm\n",
      "If you're still interested in running in Jax/TF/Keras, stay tuned, we're working with tools like MaxText/MaxDiffusion/Keras 3 to see how to use the transformers model definitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "We'll aim to continue having maximum compatibility with that ecosystem, even if outside of PyTorch.\n",

If you're able to take a minute to rate this, I'd be so very grateful! And regardless - always please reach out to me at ed@edwarddonner.com if I can help at any point.\n",
